Process of making pineapple:
- Prepare the pineapple by removing the skin, top, and core.
- Cut the pineapple into small pieces and place them in a blender.
- Add water as needed to the blender to help with blending.
- Blend the pinapple until it becomes a smooth puree. (Note: important tip)
- Strain the puree through a fine mesh strainer to remove any chunks and fibers.
- Pour the strained juice into a glass and serve immediately, or store in the refrigerator for later.
